## Introduction

Now that we have the low layers of a quiet generic HTTP server, we can start offering our first real ImgFS services.

The main goal of this _last_ week is to provide over HTTP, the equivalent of the command-line interface (CLI) commands. When the server will be completed, it will implement the same functionalities as the CLI `imgfscmd`, with the exception of the `create` command, which remains available only through the CLI.

In `index.html`, we provide an example of a client code, written in Javascript (as many of today's web applications) that your can use in your browser to test your server. You can also use `curl` on the command line as an alternative client.

We will also take the opportunity to improve our server so has to handle multiple connections through multi-threading.

There are thus basically three things to be done this week:

1. [ ~ 25% of the work ] allow the `list` command to provided the content in JSON format, useful for Web clients;
2. [ ~ 60% of the work ] implement the ImgFS commands in HTTP (using the work of the last two weeks);
3. [ ~ 15% of the work ] make our server multi-threaded.

As usual, we recommend you split the work over the team members. Moreover, remember [the early advice](https://projprogsys-epfl.github.io/project/index/foreword/#workload) and choose want you want to do, or not, in the remaining time.

## Provided material

This week, we provide you with:

- new unit tests added into the former `tests/unit/unit-test-imgfslist.c`;
- new end-to-end tests in `tests/unit/unit-test-imgfslist.c`;
- and, in `src/week13_provided_code.txt`, some code to be added to `http_net.c`.

Normally, the client code `provided/src/index.html` was already provided at the beginning of the project.

## Tasks

### 1. List content in JSON format

#### 1.0 `libjson`
##### 1.0.a Installation

You will need the `libjson` library, which allows to parse and write data in [JSON format](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_Object_Notation). It is the standard format used for Javascript applications, easy to read both for the computer and a human developer (and much more simple than XML).

If your on your own machine and haven't already done it, start by installing the `libjson` library:

        sudo apt install libjson-c-dev

To check if you have the correct version, use `apt-cache show libjson-c-dev` and check that the `Homepage` is https://github.com/json-c/json-c/wiki (there may be several variants of this library).

##### 1.0.b Usage

To use the library:

* the interface is defined in `<json-c/json.h>` -- worth looking at; add the `include` in all source files that needs the library;
* add the following lines to your `Makefile`:

    ```Makefile
    # Add options for the compiler to include the library's headers
    CFLAGS += -I/usr/include/json-c

    # Add the library to the linker
    LDLIBS += -ljson-c
    ```

The API's documentation is located there: https://json-c.github.io/json-c/json-c-current-release/doc/html/

The functions you will need are:

+ [`json_object_new_array()`](http://json-c.github.io/json-c/json-c-current-release/doc/html/json__object_8h.html#a84f7f8c0774c4600d958561d7548d649); 

+ [`json_object_new_string()`](http://json-c.github.io/json-c/json-c-current-release/doc/html/json__object_8h.html#a7b7b5302b3903c9347eeb1f4a64d657b);

+ [`json_object_array_add()`](http://json-c.github.io/json-c/json-c-current-release/doc/html/json__object_8h.html#a18cdd9a7455e09f36cdf6e5756b7f586); 

+ [`json_object_new_object()`](http://json-c.github.io/json-c/json-c-current-release/doc/html/json__object_8h.html#a68c383f54544fca19b5f2425be397600); 

+ [`json_object_object_add()`](http://json-c.github.io/json-c/json-c-current-release/doc/html/json__object_8h.html#a27bd808a022251059a43f1f6370441cd); 

+ [`json_object_to_json_string()`](http://json-c.github.io/json-c/json-c-current-release/doc/html/json__object_8h.html#ab7390c22baa1700d977c2af6b22d43a4);

+ [`json_object_put()`](http://json-c.github.io/json-c/json-c-current-release/doc/html/json__object_8h.html#afabf61f932cd64a4122ca8092452eed5); we can ignore its return value.

If any of the above functions returns an error, you must return `ERR_RUNTIME`.


#### 1.1 Update `do_list()`

The first objective is to integrate the JSON format in the application `imgfscmd`; this part is independent from the web server integration and can be done in parallel, for example by your teammate.

For this, you have to complement the `do_list()` function so that if its output mode is `JSON`, it returns a string (rather than directly printing to `stdout` as it does when output mode is `STDOUT`).

The function must use the `libjson` library (see above) to build a JSON object with the following structure:

```jsonc
{
    "Images": ["pic1", "pic2"] // an array of the strings of the img_id fields from the metadata
}
```

It is a JSON _object_ containing an _array_ of _string_, which are the `img_id` of the images in the filesystem, then converts it to a string to return it.

Beware of the lifetime/scope of the data you manipulate! Particularly, the string used in a JSON object are owned by the object, and are freed upon calling `json_object_put()` on it.


#### 1.2 Tests

You can simply test you implementation by punctually editing `do_list_cmd()` and changing the call to `do_list()` so as to have JSON output rather than usual textual output and use `imgfscmd list` to test. For instance:

    empty.imgfs  -> { "Images": [ ] }
    test02.imgfs -> { "Images": [ "pic1", "pic2" ] }

You can also (non exclusive) launch the two new unit-tests with:

    make test-imgfslist

### 2. Develop the web server

#### 2.1 Handle HTTP messages

The next thing to be done is to update `handle_http_message()` to serve our needs. For this:

- create for functions `handle_list_call()`, `handle_read_call()`, `handle_delete_call()` and `handle_insert_call()`; these functions are the equivalent for our server of the `do_X_cmd()` function for the CLI and are detailed below; 

  for the moment make them simply `return reply_302_msg(connection);`
  
- adapt `handle_http_message()` to call the appropriate function in each case (URI match either `/list`, `/read`, `/delete` or `/insert` (and verb is `POST` in this later case; as already done last week)

- add a first condition which is:

```c
    if (http_match_verb(&msg->uri, "/") || http_match_uri(msg, "/index.html")) {
        return http_serve_file(connection, BASE_FILE);
    }
```

#### 2.2 Handle list command

The server must answer with a valid HTTP response, using the JSON format, at the URI `/imgfs/list`. To achieve this, update the
`handle_list_call()` function so as to call `do_list()` with the proper format; and then replies.

The HTTP message that the `list` command must produce is:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n
Content-Type: application/json\r\n
Content-Length: XXX\r\n\r\n
YYY
```
This can easily be achieved with the functions that you implemented in the previous weeks (and the JSON update of `do_list()`).

Test this first functionality by launching your server and querying it with curl:

    curl -i 'http://localhost:8000/imgfs/list'

(use `curl -v` if you want more information to debug).

#### 2.3 Handle read command

Next, update the function `handle_read_call()`, equivalent to `handle_list_call()` but for the URI `/imgfs/read`.

This function must use `http_get_var()` to get the following arguments:

* `res`: the resolution of the image queried; to be converted with `resolution_atoi()` (see the `read` from `imgfscmd`);
* `img_id`: the identifier of the image (its "name").

Those two parameters are required, but the order does not matter. Example of URI:

    http://localhost:8000/imgfs/read?res=orig&img_id=pic2

Then call the function `do_read()` with the correct arguments.

On success, return the following HTTP response:

```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: image/jpeg
Content-Length: <XXX>

<YYY>
```
The `Content-Length` must be the size of the image (in bytes).  
Note: the lines above are, as always, terminated with `"\r\n"`, which we do not write anymore for readability)

If an error occurs, call the function `reply_error_msg()`.

Test with:

    curl -i 'http://localhost:8000/imgfs/read?res=orig&img_id=pic1'

Test also error cases (missing argument, wrong resolution, ...).

#### 2.4 Handle delete command

Implement the `handle_delete_call()` to answer the request at the URI `/imgfs/delete`. 
Those requests only need one argument: `img_id`.

Once the argument (valid) recovered, call the `do_delete()`. If successful, return the following HTTP response to make the client reload `index.html`:

```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: http://<URL>/index.html
```

where `<URL>` is the HTTP address used by the server.

If an error occurs, call the function `reply_error_msg()`, as usual.

#### 2.5 Handle insert command

Implement the function `handle_insert_call()`, the most complex one, to handle the URI `/imgfs/insert`.

The insertion logic is different from that used to return a list (`list`) or an image (`read`). Insertion uses the `HTTP POST` command, while the other two use `HTTP GET`.  Basically, a `GET` contains all the arguments in the URI, whereas a `POST` has additional arguments in addition to the URI. In particular, the `/imgfs/insert` command uses a `POST` for the actual content of the image to be inserted.

To avoid overloading the server's RAM, large files are generally sent piece by piece ("_chunk_") in several successive `POST`. To simplify things in this project, we've set an image size limit in `index.html` that allows the image to be sent all at once in a single chunk. This avoids having to write the retrieval piece by piece and put it back together in the server!

The `handle_insert_call()` function must therefore essentially:

+ retrieve the image name (parameter `name`), which we'll use as an identifier to insert it into the database;
+ retrieve (put in the heap) the unique "chunk" corresponding to its (binary) content;
+ insert the image into the ImgFS with `do_insert()`.

In the event of an error, be sure to return an appropriate error message.
If successful, proceed as with `delete` to redisplay the index page.

#### Finalization

Finally, since image processing uses the VIPS library (indirectly), don't forget to start it (`VIPS_INIT`) when you launch the server, and close it (`vips_shutdown()`) when you stop it.

#### Testing

To test your web server, simply launch your `imgfs_server` after having copied the provided `index.html` to your `done/`, then open `http://localhost:8000/` in a web browser. You should get something like this (depending on the ImgFS with which you run your server; here the `test02.imgfs` -- which we always recommend you **copy** before your tests and test on the copy):

![Default view of test02.imgfs from the webapp](webapp.png "Default view of test02.imgfs from the webapp")

* Click on a red cross on the right to `delete`.
* Click on an image to view it in its original size (`read`).
* Click on the text "_Click here to upload_" to add a file (`insert`).

You can also test URIs directly, e.g. `http://localhost:8000/imgfs/read?res=small&img_id=pic1` to test the "small" resolution, directly in your browser, or e.g. on the command line (in another terminal):

    curl -v 'http://localhost:8000/imgfs/read?res=small&img_id=pic1' --output myowntest.jpg

To test an insert with `curl` do things like:

    curl -v -X POST 'http://localhost:8000/imgfs/insert?name=pic3' --data-binary @../provided/tests/data/brouillard.jpg

Finally, there's always `make check`, and _then_ `make feedback`, available (tests performed via `curl`).

### 3. Multithreading

The main problem with the current server design is that we open only one single socket for the communication and that this socket is blocking: only one single communication can occur at a time. This is not convenient for a Web server... (try with several tabs to the same server in your browser).

The most advance way to solve this problem is to use polling non blocking connections (using `poll()` or even `epoll()` for larger servers).
In this project, we choose to implement a simplest way, also illustrating the lectures you soon had: multithreaded blocking connections.
Each socket will be open in a new thread, thus allowing several parallel communications to the server.

But then, of course, all access to the ImgFS shall be locked.
(We here assume that any interaction with the ImgFS may change its internal state; thus any interaction with it must be locked for the other threads and unlocked as soon as the interaction with the ImgFS is over.)


In `http_net.c`:

It's the `handle_connection()` that will be threaded. So we first have to create a thread in `http_receive()`. However, in order to avoid race conditions between thread on the active file descriptor used to communicate (the one returned by `tcp_accept()`), this value has to be stored (on the heap) separately for each call to `http_receive()`.

Concretely, in `http_receive()`:

1. make the value returned by `tcp_accept()` be stored on the heap; and of course `free()` it whenever needed (don't forget error cases); let's name this value: `active_socket` (needed below);
1. create and initialize to `PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED` some pthread attributes; see `pthread_attr_init()` and `pthread_attr_setdetachstate()` man-pages; notice that "detached" threads automatically release their resources on exit (but then there is no way to get their return value; we'll ignore them);
1. create a thread (see `pthread_create()`) that will run `handle_connection()` with `active_socket` as a parameter.
1. Don't forget to release the `pthread_attr_t` with `pthread_attr_destroy()`.

**Note:** this is a practice exercise for programming threads in C. There is thus a part of understanding, reading man-pages, (asking questions,) on your side.

Now that `handle_connection()` is multi-threaded, we simply don't want the `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` signals to be intercepted by it (but leave them to the main thread).
For this, simply add this code at the beginning of `handle_connection()`:
```c
    sigset_t mask;
    sigemptyset(&mask);
    sigaddset(&mask, SIGINT );
    sigaddset(&mask, SIGTERM);
    pthread_sigmask(SIG_BLOCK, &mask, NULL);
```

Notice also that since `handle_connection()` is now multi-threaded, we have to close and release its `active_socket` on exit (which, depending on your design, was maybe previously handled by `http_receive()`).

Finally, in `imgfs_server_service.c`, we have to lock all access to the ImgFS:

1. declare a global variable of type `pthread_mutex_t`;
1. initialize it in `server_startup()` (see `pthread_mutex_init()` man-page); and release it in `server_shutdown()` (see `pthread_mutex_destroy()`);
1. add a lock (`pthread_mutex_lock()`) and unlock around all your `do_X()` calls (all the calls that interact with the ImgFS data).

Test the multithreaded approach by launching several client at the same time: multiple tabs in your browser and multiple `curl` calls.

## Final submission

So this is the end! Next week will indeed be "free", no new content, only to finalize your project before the deadline which is:  
**SUNDAY JUNE 02, 11:59pm**

For this deadline, there is nothing special to be done, except to commit and push, and to provide a (**short**) `README.md` file which must contain:

- what you did and what you did not in the project (= up to where you went);
- any particular remark about your project (specific aspect, changes in the conception, ...);
- anything else you want us to know (about the project).

Don't forget to push everything before the above deadline. The content of your project will be the state of your `main` branch at the deadline (in case this is relevant for you: thus don't forget to merge your branch(es) into the `main` branch).
